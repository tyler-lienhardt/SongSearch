# SongSearch

This repository is only meant as a demonstration of my java coding. 

These are Java classes I wrote for the semester long SongSearch (a search engine for songs) project in USM's Data Structures course. The full project included many other files created by the professor, such as a GUI, raw data files, and custom data structures. For clarity, I decided to only include in this repo the classes which I wrote entirely.
